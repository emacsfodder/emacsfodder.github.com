Just a quick post about Soothe, I've updated it to run on the terminal, and adjust it's colors accordingly.

Here's a screengrab of it running in the terminal...

Soothe is also hosted on github as a [standalone repo here](https://github.com/jasonm23/emacs-soothe-theme), so it's easier for me to add it to elpa/milkbox etc.

Also I've made a iTerm2 colortheme using the Soothe palette, which you can [get over here](https://github.com/jasonm23/iterm2-color-themes)
