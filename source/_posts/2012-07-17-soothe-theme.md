This is a theme I use almost exclusively now, it's not Terminal
friendly, and I should fix that, but if you're using Emacs.app on OS
X, or in another full color window manager it'll serve you well. 

The block-highlights may put you off, I find them very helpful for
some reason I'm unable to clarify for you in any technical /
psychological / color-theory sense, but try it out anyway.

Feel free to fork modify, whatever, it's MIT Licensed.
