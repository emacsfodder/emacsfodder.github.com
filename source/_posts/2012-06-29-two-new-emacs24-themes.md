[mechanical-turq-theme.el](/downloads/mechanical-turq-theme.el)

Save them to your emacs custom theme folder, `~/.emacs.d/` by default, and in Emacs use `M-x enable-theme` to load and enable them (TAB completion will be available there, to make your life easier.)

If you have questions, let me know.
