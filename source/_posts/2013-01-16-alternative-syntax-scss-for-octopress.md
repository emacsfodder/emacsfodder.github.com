Well this isn't anything to do with Emacs, but since this blog uses
Octopress, I suppose this is as good a place as any to post this.

I've made an alternative `_syntax.scss` "part" for Octopress, just
replace your existing one, all the variables are self-contained.

{% include_code _syntax.scss lang:scss %}
