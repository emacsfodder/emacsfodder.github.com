## Modernising Emacs

I'll be posting a series of articles on modernising Emacs, with Emacs 24.4 just around the corner, it's a good time to take a look at this mythical beast, and show you how it can be tamed, by making it look and feel _more_ like a modern editor.

I'll be writing at least one article per-week, and my aim is to keep it digestible, and also dispel a few myths.  I'll also be building a .emacs.d config, as we go, and keeping it updated on github.

It's become easier than ever to modernise Emacs, but it's also even easier to miss out on many of it's awesome features, (since there are quite literally 1000s.)

Anyway, I hope you'll find this series interesting and educational.
