This is yet another Emacs24 theme, it has core support for font-lock and some basic editor elements.

At the moment, it lacks specific support for Org-mode, Helm, Gnus, Ido etc. etc. and it's not terminal friendly. (that stuff will get added, but this is quick and dirty.)

If that's good enough for you, grab it from github at [http://github.com/jasonm23/emacs-purple-haze-theme](http://github.com/jasonm23/emacs-purple-haze-theme)

No prizes for guessing where the name came from.
